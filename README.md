### Redirecting Kata-related questions to [kata-solving-help](https://gitter.im/Codewars/codewars.com/kata-solving-help) channel when new Codewarriors ask in the main channel

```markdown
@<CODEWARRIOR_NAME_HERE> For Kata-related questions, please go to [kata-solving-help](https://gitter.im/Codewars/codewars.com/kata-solving-help) channel and don't forget to include all of the following information:

- A link to the Kata you are attempting (but **not** to the trainer page, i.e. remove `/train/<SOME_LANGUAGE>` from the end of your URL if you have included it)
- The language in which you are attempting the Kata in
- What you have tried before asking for help so people don't get the impression you're just trying to get others to spoon-feed you
- Your current solution in [Markdown code blocks](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code) (note: hold `Shift` when pressing `Enter` to compose a multiline message on Gitter)
- At least one or two test cases you are failing: the input to your solution, the output of your solution, the expected output
```
